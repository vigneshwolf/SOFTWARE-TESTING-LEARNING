What is testing?

 now when did you hear the word testing in which occation or which cases

we should have recognised the word testing in school -
 so in school teached is ecpectiing us to get 100 marks in subjects so this is to konw that how much the students have learned about the lesson that have been thought by the teacher to students for that in school they conduct an exam which is kmown as test.

so the expectation of the teacher form the students marks is 100 in this marks how much did a student earn the marks. lets assume a student is getting a 60 or 70 marks with this marks the teacher assume weather the student is passed the test or not this is called as test in the school. similar in the defination of testing too. we have to slightly alter the definition.

 Then what is testing in software the definition of testing in software is.

1) expectation of the customer and the satidfaction of the customer. this is called testing in software this a point. there are lots of definition for testing in software.

2) Another theory or the definition is before delivering the final product ot the customer. checking or testing weather all the requirments of the custome is wis working properly or not this is called testing. fulfilling the customer satisfaction with the best qulaity given by the company.

Then there is word called quality. what is quality? where is it applicable how it is recognised or used.

For quality there is common consiption. which is.

consiption 1. where the product has the highest price that is considered as the best quality.

so the product with the highest price has the best quality. the answer is no!

then how we decide the quality.

consiption 2. This product is available to all and the people are suing the peoduct frequently it has been well known in the world so do we consider that as a quality product.no we can decide with this weaher it is available for all or every one is using this product. we can't consider with this.

In this case an conclusion occurs in mind of the people that is that there is a relation or a link between the price and quality. We cant gurantee that if the peice and qulaity may consider the same for sure.

There are some things we can't expect if the price is high the quality of the product will be high. No!

In some product the price may be lower but the product quality may be high.

If the product is free will it be a quality product! No.

So what is Quality? This question is still on hold.

what is qulaity.

1) Giving what the customer asked. In the way the he likes the product to be.
2) And giving the product on the expected time of the customer.
3) At the reasonable price of the customer.

In an another way we can say that too. which is.

1) Satisfying customer needs.
2) With right form / configuration.
3) At the right time.
4) at the right price.

If these points exists we call this as quality.
