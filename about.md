Today we are going to see about how to test a installed software.

Lets see.

First we have to test how the software is installing. This is called INSATLLATION TESTING.

1) Default location

If you are using a windows os the software which is going to be installed. Is going to install in c drive\program files or not we have to check that.
While your installing we have to check if there is any error in installing.

After the installation is finished we have to check by going to the control panel, programs weather the installed software is properly installed and it shows todays date.

Another way of checking the installation is non-default location

thers is no restriction that the software should be installed in the c drive on program files we can install it anywhere for example we can install it on D drive or on E drive.

In this we have two types of installation testing which is
1) default installation testing
2) non - default installation testing.

so next is upgrade testing there are two catagories which is
1) default installation testing
2) Non - default installation testing.

Here we have to check weather the upgrade is working properly in default location and non default location.
After this we have to check weather the uninstallation process in working properly or not if its not working then it has a virus or an error

These are the process for Insatallation testing.
