Discussing about software testing.

Software testing life cycle.

There are two types of life cycle in software testing.

Software Development life cycle.(SDLC)
So what is (SDLC)?
* SDLC is Software development life cycle or system development life cycle (or) a step by step process to develop a quality product.
*quality assurance and quality control work together to create a quality product.
*It is the entire process of formal and logical step to create a quality product.

Phase No.01

*Requerment collection.
*So the requerment collection is. they will collect the reqierment form the customer.
1) Buisness analyst will collect the information from the customer. customer. so they will go to the client place and collect the information of the customer.
all the colldected information will be documented so this process is called BRS/URS/CRS.
*BRS - Buisness requirment specification.
*URS - User requirment specification.
*CRS - client requirment specification.

Phase No.02

*Requerment analysis.
system analysist will be involved and he will prepare a document which is called as software requirment specification or system requirment specification. There are two sub documents one is FRS(functional requirment specification)  and another one is called NFRS(Non function reqirment document or specification)

Phase No.03
*Desing phase.
Desing analysist will prepare three documents which is
*GUI DESING document.
*DB Desing documtnt.
*Application Desing document.

Phase No.04
*Coding
SDC(SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT CODING)

Phase No.05
*Testing.

Before we deliver the software we should test the Software for that Developers and Testers will be involved.

*UNIT TESTING
*INTEGRATION TESTING
*SYSTEM TESTING
*USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING

This is the Life cycle for developing the Product that is called Software Development Life Cycle.



Software testing life cycle.
Bug life cycle.
