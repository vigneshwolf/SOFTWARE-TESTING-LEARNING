                                                   SOFTWARE TESTING LEARNING.

Lets us discuss about why do we need testing?

For any given project, the objectives of testing may include:
 To prevent defects by evaluate work products such as requirements, user stories, design, and
code
 To verify whether all specified requirements have been fulfilled
 To check whether the test object is complete and validate if it works as the users and other
stakeholders expect
 To build confidence in the level of quality of the test object
 To find defects and failures thus reduce the level of risk of inadequate software quality
 To provide sufficient information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions,
especially regarding the level of quality of the test object
 To comply with contractual, legal, or regulatory requirements or standards, and/or to verify the
test object
compliance with such requirements or standard
